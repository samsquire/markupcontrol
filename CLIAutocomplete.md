CLI Auto Complete
==

Most IDEs have powerful autocomplete functionality. Wouldn't it be cool if the same could be applied to your shell?

My theory is that manpages are freely available and typically typeset as roff files. They are relatively consistent and *could* be indexed for command line arguments.

When you type a `--` you would get a pop-up list of potential arguments you can provide. You will be told what type the argument should be in, be it a file, string or special syntax.
